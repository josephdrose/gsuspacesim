The following details the reasons behind simulator behaviors.

Our simulation was targeted to a time in the near future when man-made space ships would have unlimited thrust capability (ion drive, fusion drive) but not be much more advanced than current man-made space ships.  No shields or laser beams are used in the simulation.  Each ship is only equipped with one rocket, as they have limited cargo space.  Battles have to be fought at close range, as missiles have limited fuel and could be easily dodged if fired from far away.

The simulation accurately reflects the near lack of friction in space; momentum is also properly simulated.
